	<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>
	<p>From western Philadelphia I hail</br>
	where in my youth I'd play upon the green</br>
	'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd</br>
	by ruffians contemptible and mean.</p>
	<p>Although the spat was trivial and brief,</br> 
	it wounded my dear mother deep within;</br>
	and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,</br> 
	she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.</p>
	<p>When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,</br>
	I came upon a coachman most unique;</br>
	and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,</br>
	despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.</p>
	<p>I survey all the land with princely mien</br>
	in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>
